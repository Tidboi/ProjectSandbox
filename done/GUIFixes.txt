GUI updates:

12: Add a 2mm deadzone around the edges
	This basically requires resizing and reorganizing everything so this would probably need to be done before anything else

1: Remove title bar
	Add line " window.wm_attributes('-fullscreen', 'True') " right before tk.mainloop()
	
2: Remove cursor
	Add line " window.config(cursor="none") " after the line from issue 1
	
3: Remove "+" sign from temperature:
	Unresolved, Can probably be accomplished by using .split('+')[1] to remove the plus sign
	
4: Temperature should only be 1 decimal place precision
	Unresolved, the code to set current temp is only on the RPi 4, should be easy to round though
	
5: Increase font size of HOME and SAVE
	Find and replace
	
6: Remove degrees symbol
	Find and remove all instances of u'\xb0'
	
7: Add limits for bakeout screen:
	copy logic for making sure time is greater than 0 and set max time of 999 as well as temperature range 60-80
	default time 90 mins, default temp 80
	
8: Add limits for warmup screen:
	copy logic for making sure time is greater than 0 and set max time of 999 as well as temperature range 20-40	
	default time 90 mins, default temp 20
	
9: Center text inside of buttons
	The text inside the buttons is already supposedly set to centered so this would require extra work to make them "off center"
	
10: "Warm up" and "Bake out" should be centered in the settings screen
	Setting rely from 0.4 to 0.5 will accomplish this, but it looks pretty bad without adjusting everything else
	
11: Temperature readout should be centered on main screen
	Setting rely from 0.4 to 0.5 will accomplish this, but it looks pretty bad without adjusting everything else
	
13: After pressing save, screen should blink
	This could be done by clearing all widgets, adding a small delay and redrawing all widgets. That would be a pain.
	An easier solution would be to change text color to green or similar
	
14: Temperature readout on bakeout screen is smaller than on warmup screen.
	After making other GUI adjustmets first, make sure font sizes match between screens
	
15: Buttons change color when clicked:
	Add " activeforeground='COLOR' " and " activebackground='COLOR' " into each button where the active bg color
	matches the button color and active fg color matches the text color
	
16: Settings screens should happen after 5 seconds regardless of release
	This is probably do-able by using the "after" function inside the button press callback and then checking if the button has been released within the 5 seconds or not
